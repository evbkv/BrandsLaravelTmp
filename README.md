# BrandsLaravelTmp

## Description

This is a web application template built using the Laravel framework. It serves as a starting point for developing web applications that include a user section designed as a Single-Page Application (SPA) and an administrative section with different user roles.

The user section of this template provides an Instagram-like user interface, featuring an endless feed where users can view and interact with content. Additionally, it includes various implemented sections such as search, rubricator, and full-screen content viewing, enhancing the overall user experience. The user interface is implemented using the [InstHtmlTmp](https://github.com/evbkv/InstHtmlTmp) HTML template.

The SPA functionality is developed using JavaScript functions, without relying on any third-party frameworks. This ensures a lightweight and efficient implementation for seamless user interactions.

The theme of this project is currently centered around brands, but it can be easily customized and replaced with any desired theme to match your specific project requirements.

Please note that this project is currently under development. There are plans to add detailed comments throughout the codebase and create a comprehensive user manual to provide detailed guidance on using and extending the application.

Example project: [eeka.site](https://eeka.site).
